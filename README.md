This course is a hands-on and pragmatic introduction to computer tools and theoretical aspects of the new use of data by humanists of different disciplines. Furthermore, it will serve as an introduction to the techniques and methods used today to make sense of data from a Humanities point of view.

In that sense, *Data, the Humanist's New Best Friend* is divided into three blocks (plus one extra block that covers a programming review):

- Data Mining, explaining the past and predicting the future by means of data analysis.
- Text Analysis, producing valuable information from text sources.
- Networks Science, understanding complex structures by analyzing the relationships among their entities.
